# Final Rendezvous - How To Play

## Object of the Game
You and your fellow players are international spies on a mission to rendezvous
with a secret agent (Agent X) in an unknown location, somewhere on the globe.

The first player to make a successful rendezvous with Agent X wins the game.

To make the rendezvous, you must:
* Determine where Agent X is and travel to that city
* Give Agent X the correct codeword

---

## Basic Mechanics
Players start in a random city on the map with 5 random cards in their hand.
There is a single pile of cards to draw from during the game.

Players take turns in which they can choose to do up to 3 of the following
actions:
* Gather resources or information (pick up a card)
* Play one of their action cards
* Travel to a new destination
* Exchange information with another player or a double agent
* Attempt to rendezvous with Agent X

Your aim is to move around, and gather resources and information. When you are
confident that you know the Codeword and Agent X's location, travel to that
location and give Agent X the codeword to make the Final Rendezvous!

---

## Game Setup
*Agent X* can be in any one of up to 40 cities. X's location is determined at the
beginning of the game and does not change.

*The Codeword* is randomly selected from 1000 words, before the game starts. All
the codewords are singular nouns which represent a physical object e.g. "Vase"
or "Banana". They are all comprised of a single word with no numbers, hyphens,
spaces or accents.

*8 Double Agents* are randomly distributed throughout the globe. Each double agent
holds one piece of information which might be a clue to the Codeword, or Agent X's
location.

*Each player starts in a different, random city on the map.*

*Play starts with a random player*, selected by the computer at the start of the
game.

## The Deck
Progressing through the game is done with the help of the cards in your hand.
You can hold as many cards in your hand as you wish - there is no limit.

There are 4 types of card in the deck:

### Money Cards
Money allows you to travel to cities and barter for information.

### Action Cards
Action cards allow you to do useful things outside of the normal rules of the
game.

### Double Agent Cards
These cards tell you where you _might_ find a double agent who can give you
extra information.

### Information Cards
Information cards are clues to either the city Agent X is in, or the Codeword.
However, not all information can be trusted! You will need to find multiple
pieces of corroborating information to be sure of the correct location and
Codeword.

When you see an information card, you will not know for sure whether the clues
point towards the city or the Codeword, or if the clue is a red herring!

Only by seeing multiple pieces of information can you be sure of the patterns
which point to the right location and Codeword.

## The Game Turn
Each turn, a player can take up to 3 of the below actions. With the exception of
the Final Rendezvous, they can repeat an action multiple times in one turn.

A player does not have to take all 3 actions. They can choose to pass.

### Action: Pick up a card
Pick up one new card from the draw pile. Each card picked-up uses up an action.

### Action: Play an action card
Put an action card into play by turning it face up. This invokes the action as
per the instructions on the card. Once actions are used-up, they will be placed
into the discard pile.

### Action: Travel to a new destination
A list of all destinations is shown adjacent to the main map. This includes the
distance from your current location and the cost of a ticket to reach a new
destination. The further away the destination, the more your ticket will cost.

### Action: Exchange information
You can exchange information with double agents, or another player. For more
details of how exchanges work, including examples, see the Detailed Instructions
section.

*Double Agents*
If you land in a city with a double agent, the agent will be shown to you on
your screen.

For an action, you may choose to get information from the double agent. If the
agent still has their information card, they will give it to you. However, if
they have already given away their information card, you will learn nothing, but
still have used up an action! Another player got to the double agent before you!

Your rival players will not know that your city contains a double agent, unless
they have activated an action card which allows them to see double agents'
locations.

*Other Players*
To exchange information with another player, you must barter with them. You will
not know what information other players have or if it will be useful to you.

Any player can discuss with any other player at any time if they may have an
information card which might be useful. This can be done as openly as you wish,
but bear in mind that all players are listening! Other players may interrupt the
bartering process and attempt to sell their information instead.

Once you have agreed a price for exchanging an information card with another
player, click the exchange information button, select the player and enter the
amount of money to be exchanged. The other player must then select an information
card to give in exchange for the money.

### Action: Attempt a Final Rendezvous with Agent X
When you are sure you know the correct Codeword and location, you can attempt
the final rendezvous to end the game!

Read the ["End Game"](#end-game-making-the-rendezvous) section below to see
how this works.

## Interpreting The Information
As you progress through the game, you will be exposed to increasing amounts of
information which helps you derive Agent X's location and the Codeword.

Each piece of information you encounter could be a clue to either the Codeword
or the location. Unfortunately, not all information can be trusted; some of the
clues are red herrings, designed to put you off the scent!

When you start to see multiple pieces of information corroborating the Final
Rendezvous city and Codeword, you can be sure you have the right intelligence
to end the game.

Each information card will take the form of a picture, or words, that may hint at
the correct location or Codeword. You will not necessarily know which piece of
intelligence the clue is for or if the clue is a red herring.

Information is held on cards which can be exchanged throughout the game. However,
you also have a notebook where you can make notes, so once you have seen a piece
of information, you can take a note of what you've seen, then use your information
card to barter for money with other players.

Accurate information is scarce. All the double agents hold one piece of
information, and the rest of the information cards will be distributed amongst
all players and the deck. You must move around to find the double agents, or pay
other players for information, until you are satisfied you have worked out the
right location and Codeword.

## End Game - Making the Rendezvous
When a player thinks they know the city and the Codeword, they must travel to
the city and click the action button to make the rendezvous with Agent X.

When the button is clicked, you are asked to confirm you wish to try and make
the rendezvous. If you say "yes" you *must* then guess the codeword.

*If the city, or the Codeword is incorrect, you are permanently out of the
game!* Other players will be told that you are out but not which piece/s of
information were wrong.

However, if you have correctly identified the city and the Codeword, *you have
won!!*
